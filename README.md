
# Efficient Data Stream Anomaly Detection

## Overview
This project implements a real-time anomaly detection system for a simulated data stream. The system identifies unusual patterns in continuous floating-point number sequences, which could represent metrics such as financial transactions or system performance indicators.

## Features
- Real-time data stream generation with seasonal patterns and anomalies.
- Anomaly detection using a Z-score-based algorithm.
- Visualization of data streams and detected anomalies.
- Error handling and data validation to ensure robust performance.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following Python packages:
- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Getting Started

Installation

Clone the repository or download the project files.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
Install the necessary packages using the command above.
Running the Project
To run the anomaly detection script, execute the following command:


python main.py
This will start the data stream simulation and visualization process.

Output
The project will generate an output.csv file containing the simulated data stream, including timestamps, values, and anomaly flags. Additionally, real-time visualizations of the data and detected anomalies will be displayed.

Error Handling and Validation
The program includes error handling for:

Invalid or missing data points.
Out-of-range values.
Visualization errors.

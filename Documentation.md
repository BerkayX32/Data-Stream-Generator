## Introduction
This project implements a real-time anomaly detection system for simulated data streams. It identifies unusual patterns in continuous floating-point sequences, which could represent various metrics, such as financial transactions or system performance indicators.

## Installation
To install the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
4. Install the required packages with:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the main script to start the data stream simulation and anomaly detection:


python main.py

The program will generate an output.csv file with the data stream and visualizations in real time.

Components
Data Stream Generation
The data stream is generated with seasonal patterns, noise, and occasional anomalies. The function generate_data_point is responsible for creating these data points.

Anomaly Detection
Anomalies are detected using a Z-score algorithm implemented in the detect_anomaly function. The system flags any data point that exceeds a predefined threshold.

Visualization
The program uses Matplotlib to provide real-time visualizations of the data stream and detected anomalies. The visualization updates continuously as new data points are processed.

Error Handling and Validation
The program includes checks to ensure:

Valid data points are processed.
Out-of-range values are filtered out.
Errors during visualization are handled gracefully.
Examples
Test Cases
Normal Data Stream: Ensure the system detects no anomalies under regular conditions.
Anomalous Data Points: Validate that the system correctly flags data points introduced as anomalies.
